# Json-Arduino
Part of my JSON library ported to 32-bit Arduinos

This is a port of my JsonTextReader library (https://github.com/codewitch-honey-crisis/Json) and my LexContext class (https://github.com/codewitch-honey-crisis/LexContext) to the Arduino platform

It will not compile for just any Arduino. It requires that the platform support 64-bit doubles and 64-bit integers. It has been tested with the ESP32
